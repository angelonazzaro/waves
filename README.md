# Introduction 
Waves is a web music player built with `React`. <br>
You may have seen other repositories with similar name, code and structure since the original idea behind this project comes from [DevEd](https://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed)'s React Course. 
<br>
This is **my personal** implementation with some added features. 

## Demo 


## How to Install
In order to install and use Waves you'll have to:
- Install `NodeJS` on your machine 
- Clone this repository
- Start the application 

### Install NodeJS on your machine
There are different ways to install `NodeJS`, but the simplest way is to navigate to the official [site](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the LTS version.

Once you have downloaded and installed NodeJS you can check if the installation was successful by running `node -v` in your terminal. If NodeJS has been successfully installed on your machine you should see something like this:

### Clone this Repository
In order to copy this repository you can go two ways. <br> 
The first way is to click on the green button in the top right corner and go to `Download ZIP` and extract it on your machine. 
<br>
The other way is to use clone the repo via `git`. Open git bash or your terminal if you are on a Unix-based system and type: 
```
git clone https://github.com/sl1mSha4dey/waves.git
```

### Start the application 
Once you have the repository on your machine, navigate with your terminal to the folder where you have cloned or extracted it: 
```
cd repository-folder
```
Once you are on the directory, by the `dir` or `ls` command you should get this output:

Now proceed to install all the packages needed to run the project by running the following command: 
```
npm install 
```
Once the process has terminated, you can run the application by running: 
```
npm start
```
Your application will be available at https://localhost:3000. ENJOY!!
